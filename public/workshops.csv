I employ a model in which households make two-stage decisions on car ownership and utilization. I estimate model parameters by combining micro-level data from a household survey and macro-level aggregate data on the Japanese new car market from 2006 through 2013. Interestingly, several system changes in the Japanese feebate created rich variations in vehicle prices across vehicles and over time during the sample period. I use such exogenous variation to overcome the vehicle price endogeneity associated with demand estimation. Counterfactual analyses show that the Japanese feebate results in a significant increase in social welfare while augmenting environmental externalities. In particular, the rebound effect induced by the feebate cancels out approximately 7% of the reduction in CO2 emissions that would originally have been attained by the improvement in fuel economy. In addition, I find that a fuel tax dominates a product tax, an alternative feebate scheme considered in the counterfactuals, on efficiency and distributional grounds. This suggests that substituting the existing automobile-related taxes, such as the weight tax, with a fuel tax or a carbon tax would improve social welfare without increasing the tax burden on low-income households in Japan."

This paper examines differences in distance dependence of internal migration by personal attributes. In particular, we focus on gender differences in the degree to which people are tolerant of distance when they choose a place to live. We use panel data in Japan that includes residential locations and various personal attributes, including gender, education level, and employment status. In this study, we find that there are gender differences in distance dependence of internal migration. The migration of women is less dependent on distance than that of men. In other words, women are more likely than men to accept a long-distance move, other things being equal. This tendency is not observed at the aggregate level because it is negated by differences due to other characteristics. The use of microdata allows us to remove the differences due to other personal attributes and to extract only the gender difference to find the hidden fact. Moreover, our results suggest that there is another gender difference."

Using monthly foreign beer product sales information from the POS data, we conduct an event study, based on a synthetic control method (SCM). The result found in the analysis is that the actual Corona beer sales skyrocketed after the shock, compared to the synthetic Corona beer sales. Although this huge positive impact shrank after a couple of months, the actual Corona beer sales amount continues to be larger than the synthetic sales amount. One obvious mechanism that can induce this positive effect is that Corona beer attracted consumers' attention after the shock. To verify this story, we compare the time series of the estimated effect on Corona beer sales and the (relative) search volume for ""Korona biru"" (Corona beer in Japanese), extracted from Google Trends data. The variable can be viewed as the extent of people's attention to Corona beer. Time-varying Granger causality test suggests that the web search Granger causes an increase in Corona beer sales after the shock, which can be interpreted that more attention on the Corona beer is a positive indicator of its larger sales amount. Our results indicate that, even when the attention to a product is associated with a negative image, and even when the quality is kept unchanged, the sales amount can be increased by coming under the spotlight."

However, it is difficult to capture the communication quantitively, and the accumulation of empirical evidence is scarce. Although there are studies that exploit collaborative research relationships in patenting and scientific research, they lack external validity to general economic activities because not many companies necessarily engage in such R&D activities. This study uses business card exchange data from Eight, a business card management app managed by Sansan, Inc., to capture communication information among employees belonging to companies and estimates the agglomeration economies through communications. Business card exchange is a common practice, at least in Japanese companies, and it can capture interactions among employees in a wide range of business categories. We find that the distance reduces business card exchanges, and the distance elasticities at the industry level are correlated with the industry-level agglomeration measures. Those suggest that business interactions are the source of urban agglomeration."

I explain this by developing a model that has heterogeneous income-elasticities and mobile agents. Either heterogeneous fundamental productivities or heterogeneous amenities generate the specialization pattern through the home market effect. The city with fundamentally better productivity or amenity becomes larger, offers a higher wage, and specialize in income-elastic sectors. Moreover, the model reveals the importance of tradable-sector shares in cross-location wage patterns."

However, people are not able to see the relevant petition activities of their own interest in the first place but are overwhelmed by the information of highly popular petition cases. To solve this problem, we propose a social media intelligence mechanism that combines factors from the theory of persuasion that affect human attitudes: emotion, cognition, and morality, to make it easier for petition cases to find participants who match the interests of the issue by recommending personalized rankings for different participants. In this study, for each petition case, our method can improve the user experience of the online petition platform, which in turn increases public engagement and the case success rate. Ultimately, our mechanism will enable citizens to make a genuine difference in society by actively responding to online petitions that are tailored to their specific concerns."

Each household’s idiosyncratic taste is assumed to follow a Brownian motion in space. The index variable of the Brownian motion is distance from the CBD instead of time, which means that the taste is a random function of distance. Each household has their initial location for which they know their taste but they do not know their taste for other locations. The Brownian motion captures the idea that the extent of uncertainty is greater for a far-away location. In the case that there are two income types, I show that there may be a region in the city where two types collocate. Furthermore, in such a mixed region, the lot size for lower income households may be decreasing in distance from the CBD. These two implications are sharp contrast to the standard monocentric city model without uncertainty, and are investigated empirically using American Community Survey 2015 public data and American Housing Survey 1996 Metro data."

Using plant-level data for 1902, including the foundation year of each plant, we explored how the experience years-size profiles of plants differ before and after the regime change. Plants were found to grow much faster after the regime change, and the acceleration of growth after the regime change was much greater for the plants in exporting industries, industries intensively using steam power, and plants adopting the corporate form. These findings suggest that access to markets, access to modern technologies, and availability of the modern corporate form were the channels through which the regime change affected the experience years-size profile of plants. Furthermore, long-term historical data and narratives on two plants support the results.

Large-scale data collected from mobile devices, including mobile phone GPS data, allow us to observe urban dynamics before, during, and after disaster events in an unprecedented spatial-temporal scale. Using such data, I study the recovery dynamics and resilience of urban systems to disasters using a data-driven modeling approach, with particular emphasis on the complex interdependencies among social, economic, and infrastructure systems. A case study in Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria reveals a trade-off relationship in urban development, where developed cities with robust infrastructure systems have higher recovery efficiency of critical services, however, have socio-economic networks with lower self-reliance during crises, which lead to loss of community resilience. Managing and balancing the socio-economic self-reliance alongside physical infrastructure robustness is key to resilient cities."

We find that rising temperatures reduce rural-urban migration in poor countries and increase such migration in middle-income countries. These asymmetric migration responses are consistent with a simple model where rural-urban earnings differentials and liquidity constraints interact to determine rural-to-urban migration flows. We also confirm these temperature effects using country-level observations constructed by aggregating the grid cell level data. We project that expected warming in the next century will encourage further urbanization in middle-income countries such as Argentina, but it will slow down urban transition in poor countries like Malawi and Niger."

To do so, we first detect locations of houses of homeless persons by using a UAS (Unmanned Aerial System; drone) and find the optimal number of clusters of houses based on single linkage clustering, one of the hierarchical cluster analysis methods. After detecting clusters, we evaluate the effect of locating in a larger cluster on the homeless person's affluence, which is measured by temperature of each house in winter. Our results show that the larger a cluster to which a house belongs is, the higher its temperature is, indicating that living in a larger cluster makes them live in more affluence. In addition, we find a negative bias of the uninstrumented estimates, which can be interpreted as an indication of negative self-selection of homeless persons to sort into a large community. That is, more disadvantaged homeless persons sort into a larger cluster, and by doing so, they benefit from living in a larger community via interaction with those living in the same cluster."

It estimates a structural model endogenizing airfares and flight frequency by using data on Japanese domestic routes and conducts simulation analyses. It is found that while per-flight charges hardly affect airfares, an increase in per-passenger charges significantly raises airfares with the average pass-through rate of 97.5 percent. The pass-through rates are overestimated when flight frequency is treated as exogenous. Both types of charges decrease flight frequency. In addition, on nearly 80 percent of the routes in the sample, while per-passenger charges are superior to per-flight charges from the viewpoint of airline profits, the order is reversed from the viewpoints of the passenger and social surpluses."

From the main result, we find that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter smaller than 10_m (PM10) effect positively on both medical expenditure and number of hospital visits. For respiratory related diseases, carbon monoxide (CO) has a positive effect on medical expenditure and ozone (O3) has a positive effect on hospital visit. The estimated coefficients imply that NO2 and PM10 increase hospital visit by 1.35% and 0.36% respectively, and the medical expenditure is increased by 0.27% and 0.07% respectively.

The spatial patterns differ markedly by marital status and the presence of children. For married mothers, the spatial clusters of low participation and regularemployment rates are largely located in the inner suburbs, many of which overlap with the spatial clusters of long male commute times. The spatial regression results indicate that for married mothers, a longer commute time is significantly associated with lower participation and regular employment rates, while for unmarried and childless married women, these associations are mostly nonsignificant. Among married mothers, the magnitude of the negative associations is greater for college graduates than for those with a high school education or less, suggesting that highly educated mothers are especially sensitive to commute times. We argue that the spatial transportation constraint intensifies the household division of labor, resulting in unique patterns for married mothers."

Two points are focused on: First, there is a puzzle that a number of FTA has been rapidly increasing for a couple of decades, compared to that of CU, while most of theoretical studies in the literature predict CU can bring on a higher level of national welfare than FTA. Second, in the real economy, why are most of CUs formed between countries located closely to each other, while FTAs can be formed, even if the countries are located far from each other? To shed light on these questions, we build a model featured by two key factors: First, we examine a situation in the presence of trade costs. Second, tariff policy is determined under the regime of representative democracy. As a result, in the case where the income distribution in the countries is largely skewed, FTA is able to realize a higher level of national welfare than CU, due to the existence of trade costs. However, in the case where the member countries are located so closely to each other, CU can realize higher welfare than FTA can."

We then employ the inequality decomposition technique of a Theil’s second measure to explore the extent to which the efficiency factor contributes to interprovincial income inequality.Our efficiency analysis reveals that most Indonesian provinces improved their relative inefficiency considerably in both resource utilization and allocation. Moreover, the relative inefficiency became convergent across provinces for the period. However, several provinces with serious pure technical and scale inefficiencies still exist in 2010. The province of Yogyakarta critically underperformed in resource utilization, and Central Kalimantan and Papua operate at further suboptimum scales. The former needs to develop appropriate mechanisms to efﬁciently use its given resources, while the latter need to mitigate business-unfriendly regulations and deal with financial constraints. The inequality decomposition analysis shows that interprovincial convergence of inequality in overall technical inefficiency largely contributed to the reduction in income inequality. The convergence of inequality in resource utilization inefficiency had a greater impact on inequality convergence in overall technical inefficiency than in resource allocation inefficiency. In 2010, pure labor productivity became a substantial new factor in determining income inequality. Since this measure is affected by per capita physical and human capital and technology, the spatial allocation imbalance of these factors has become a new concern in Indonesia."

The opposing policy becomes the next status-quo if it receives at least q votes. We characterize stochastically stable policies under a boundedly rational choice rule of voters. Under the best response rule with mutations, a Condorcet winner is stochastically stable for all q-quota rules, and uniquely so if q is greater than the minmax quota.

The role of communication costs,"We show how transport and communication costs interact to shape the way firms organize their activities across space. We consider the following three organizational types: (i) integrated firms in which all activities are conducted under the same roof, (ii) horizontal firms, which operate several plants producing the same good at different locations, and (iii) vertical firms, which perform distinct activities at separated locations. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the three types of organization to coexist within the same region. More specifically, the smaller region accommodates the three types of organizational forms, whereas firms located in the larger region are all spatially integrated. We then study how transport and communication costs affect the numbers of firm-types. First, lower transport makes competition softer because firms are able to change their organization form in response to a drop in transport costs. By contrast, the non-cooperative adjustment in firms' organizational forms does not allow them to compensate for the effects associated with less expensive communication flows. The reason for this difference in results is that the two types of spatial frictions differ in nature: in the proximity-concentration trade-off, lower transport costs weaken the need for proximity, while lower communication costs foster deconcentration."

The Role of Demand Substitutability in Competition among the Big and the Small,"We establish a model of market competition among big and small firms and investigate how demand substitutability affects the impacts of big firms' entry on incumbents. We focus on the relative strength of two opposing effects of entry on the incumbent big firms' demand: the direct substitution effect among the big firms (negative), and the indirect feedback effect through the change in the aggregated behavior of small firms (positive). If the substitutability between big and small firms is sufficiently high, the indirect effect dominates the direct effect, and the big incumbents' equilibrium prices and profits increase. We show that the welfare effects are ambiguous, which calls for careful assessment for regulating big firms' entry."

This paper aims to understand the mobility of Hispanic immigrants, particularly whether gender differences exist in their mobility. Using National Household Travel Survey data for 2009, this paper finds that the gender difference in mobility is greater among Hispanics, particularly for low-income Hispanic immigrants, than for other populations. Hispanic female immigrants are substantially less likely to be drivers than their male counterparts and females of other race/ethnicity groups. Moreover, the probability of being a driver is persistently low for Hispanic female immigrants even after years of residing in the U.S., while driver status of females in other race/ethnicity groups increases quickly as they stay longer in the U.S. Hispanic female immigrants are likely not actively choosing to be non-drivers; if they are drivers, they drive more than females of other race/ethnicity groups. Although regression analysis does not prove causal relationships between low-income status and driver status, there are policy implications if barriers to becoming a driver limit training or employment and contribute to low-income status. More detailed analysis is anticipated to detail the mobility challenges Hispanic female immigrants face."

New paradigms such as dynamics of complex systems, self-organization, evolution theory, have been recognized for better understanding the evolutional process of regional spatial structure. The spatial evolution of regional system can be seen as a cumulative and aggregated order which results from numerous locally made decisions.As a case study in tourism, this presentation builds a mathematic model based on asymmetric monopolistic competition, scale economy, travel cost, preference for variety, and product/service differentiations between inland and coastal region in China since tourism has experienced a period of rapid growth in recent years. However, the traditional mathematic model is based on over-simplifying assumptions, such as heterogeneity irrelevant, fully-rational agents, no interactions among economic agents, unable to adapt and evolve. In addition, the equilibrium analysis is not suitable for dynamic research.To overcome the weakness of traditional economic model and equilibrium analysis in traditional tourism research, the presentation puts forward an approach to integrate economic model with agent-based modeling for better understanding the evolutional process of tourism systems in different scenarios. Therefore, instead of making nonlinear systems tractable by modeling complex building blocks with few interactions, we can make them understandable by modeling simple building blocks with many interactions among different agents in different areas based on spatial economic model. The TourSwarm, a computational environment we developed, contains multiple economic interactions between tourist and firm agents that are crucial in understanding dynamic process and mechanism because the basic force driving the tourism system is inherently microscopic. This parallel processing agent-based approach has shown various advantages over existing economic approaches such as neoclassical model and equilibrium analysis. By using agent-based modeling and out-of-equilibrium simulation, this presentation gives a detailed discussion on the impact factors such as continuous reduction of travel cost to inland region, continuous reduction of substitution elasticity between inland and coast region, continuous reduction of substitution elasticity of product and service in inland region. Therefore, microscopic simulation emphasizes the way in which locally made decisions and interaction between all kinds of local agents give rise to global patterns is highly appropriate."

When exogenous parameters change, an equilibrium state may become unstable, and the urban dynamical system will exhibits a transient response i.e., a convergence to a new equilibrium. For this purpose, we construct a gradient system in terms of the obtained Gateaux derivatives and analyze the gradient system in the finite dimensional case. We conclude that the equilibrium of the proposed dynamical model coincides with the Nash equilibrium of the static model."

We examine a regional model where the economic geography evolves, giving the firm an incentive to relocate. We show that government competition for FDI leads the firm to make efficient location choices such that it is more likely to relocate than in the absence of such international rivalry. This is because the national tax/subsidy offers absorb some of the firm’s relocation costs."

Evidence from Taiwanese Plant Level Data (with Yung-Hsing Guo),"The domestic market consequences of firms' investing abroad have attracted attentions both of economists and policymakers. In particular, the effect of outward foreign direct investment (FDI) on domestic labor market outcomes are controversial in economic theories. Moreover, accelerating the movement of domestic production to abroad raised public concern about hollowing out of domestic technologies and employments. We investigate the impact of FDI towards China on plants' productivity and employment, using Taiwanese representative manufacturing plant-level data and exploiting an FDI regulation change in China in 2002 as a significant variation. Our difference-in- differences estimates reveal a heterogeneity in the response of Taiwanese plants to this change in the regulation, that are consistent with the theoretical prediction by Sethupathy (2013): plants in deregulated industries which newly invested in China after 2000 experienced an increase in their productivity, employment and operating sales while plants in those industries which had already invested in China at 2000 decreased both employment and operating sales. We do not find any differential trends between plants in deregulated industries and those in other industries before the regulation change. Furthermore, we do not find a statistical evidence on the hollowing out effects of FDI on domestic market outcomes in deregulated industries."

A numerical model is used to show that total GHG emissions may be lower under building height restrictions, but only when they are very strict. Welfare is not concave in the strictness of building height limits, so either no limit or a very strict one might maximize welfare.

First, applying the GB-pricing model in Kariya (1993) to these GB prices, we derive the term structures of interest rates (TSIRs) and discuss on the Maastricht convergence condition for the IR-differentials among these states relative to the German TSIRs and make some observations on some divergent tendencies. The results are associated with the business cycles and budgetary condition of each state. In the second part, to substantiate this viewpoint, we first make credit risk price spread (CRiPS) analysis on price differentials and derive the term structures of default probabilities (TSDPs) of the French, Italian, Spanish and Greek GBs relative to the German GBs, where the corporate bond (CB) model proposed in Kariya (2013) is used in the derivation.  Then it is empirically shown that the TSDPs show a significant divergent movement at the end of 2011, affected by the Euro Crisis. In addition, the TSDPs of these GBs are empirically shown to be almost linear functions of the differences of the TSIRs, which enables us to state the Maastricht condition in terms of DP. Thirdly the effectiveness of our TSDPs is empirically verified by comparing them with the corresponding credit default swap (CDSs) against US dollars."

(with Dingyang Zhou & Zhuoying Zhang),"Rapid progress of economic development and urbanization has created a water demand crisis in the Beijing-Tianjin metropolis in North China. This study evaluates the metropolis’s carrying capacity under water resource constraints by examining the discrepancies between the actual water requirements, water usage and the locally available water resources; the water footprint (WF) approach is used to assess associated changes in these variables. A structural decomposition analysis is applied to decompose the driving factors of the increasing water requirements in the Beijing-Tianjin metropolis. The results indicate that the increasing actual water requirements are far greater than the increase in the locally available water resources and water usage, especially in Beijing. The discrepancy between the actual water requirements, locally available water resources and water usage sharply increased from 2002 to 2007, which introduced a serious water crisis and more significant constraints on the water resources. The carrying capacity was based on freshwater transfer, groundwater extraction and VW trade. Four separate factors are considered to contribute to the effects of actual water requirement changes from 2002 to 2007: technological improvements, economic system efficiency, scale effect and consumption structure changes. Significant water-saving efforts via technological improvement have been made in the Beijing-Tianjin metropolis in the past. However, these improvements could not cover the increasing actual water requirements driven by economic and population growth. To address the two challenges (i.e., regional development and the water shortage) and to enhance the carrying capacity in terms of sustainability in the future, the Beijing-Tianjin metropolis should adopt a more active role in controlling the growth of population and increasing the WF. Although increased water resources and interregional virtual water trades with other regions have greatly contributed to alleviating the water crisis in recent years in the Beijing-Tianjin metropolis, the water saving potential may be realized through the readjustment of industrial structure, consumption structure, urban spatial structure and economic instruments in the future."

Smith),"City size distributions are known to be well approximated by power laws across many countries. One popular explanation for such power-law regularities is in terms of random growth processes, where power laws arise asymptotically from the assumption of iid growth rates among all cities within a given country. But this assumption has additional consequences. Since all subsets of cities have the same statistical properties, each subset must exhibit essentially the same power law. Moreover, this common power law (CPL) property must hold regardless of the spatial relations among cities. Using data from the US, this paper shows first that spatial partitions of cities based on geographical proximity are significantly more consistent with the CPL property than are random partitions. It is then shown that this significance becomes even stronger then proximity among cities is measured in terms of trade linkages rather than simple geographical distance. These results provide compelling evidence that spatial relations between cities do indeed matter for city-size distributions. Further analysis show that these results hinge on the natural ""spacing out"" property of city patterns in which larger cities tend to be widely spaced apart with smaller cities organized around them."

Households are identical in their choices and endowments. They have three choices of mode to reach CBD. The dense city streets are direct but expensive and slow. The radial highways are faster but need to rely heavily on city streets to reach them. The circumferential highway(s) provides quicker travel to avail radial highways and thus reduces total travel cost. However, depending on the location and capacity of such highway(s), the city is divided by three distinct market areas which ultimately determine the size and shape of the city. Households are utility maximizer taking prices and characteristics of highway network as given. The social planner optimizes global equilibrium utility by adjusting the characteristics of highway network (e.g. location and capacity of the circumferential highway). In our analysis, we do not consider congestion and we assume that the wage and the agricultural land rent are exogenous. We nd that the general optimality condition of the transportation network improvement is such that the marginal cost of improvement is equal to the marginal increase in the aggregated dierential land rent. Furthermore, we illustrate a numerical solution of optimal highway network with a circumferential highway using Leontief Utility function. We nd that for a city with a larger number of radial highways, the optimal location of the circumferential highway is further out closer to the city boundary."

At the individual levels, smart mobile devices are equipped with GPS sensors that enable user locations to be tracked in real-time, which enable personalized location-based services to be provided. Consequently, there is an increasing trend toward use of mobile apps to plan and manage activities. At the corporate levels, such digital traces can be aggregated and analysed to accurate determine/predict demand patterns and congestion. In this talk, I will present computational problems relating to the operation of theme parks. From the visitors' perspective, the most important aspect is in maximizing their enjoyment in the park; while from the operator's perspective, one aspect is in congestion management (relieving long wait-times for rides and shows). The key in satisfying both aspects lie in effective coordination of visitors through proper dynamic guidance and well-timed incentives. This talk discusses two problems arising from visitor flow coordination. I will first present the problem relating to single-agent dynamic stochastic route guidance, which is a generalization of the Orienteering Problem (Prize-Collecting Traveling Salesman). I will present an efficient and effective search method, and a mobile application developed for a large theme park operator. I then describe the problem of smoothing out demands/congestion through the use of incentives which are communicated via mobile devices. Here, we consider a network where each agent (i.e. visitor) maximizes his utility of pleasure seeking. Since incentives themselves are resources that are limited, they need to be carefully allocated in order to achieve the desired outcome of reducing congestion. More precisely, given a certain incentive budget level, the goal is to distribute the incentives to different agents at different time points so that certain congestion thresholds are satisfied at equilibrium. We present a mathematical model on how a solution might be computed."

Wage is higher in the bigger country but the difference vanishes when trade cost vanishes (globalization). Under increasing demand elasticity (decreasing elasticity of substitution) the size of a firm is smaller in the bigger country and the mass of firms shows Home-market effect, and both countries apply dumping. The opposite effects occur under decreasing demand elasticity. Globalization increases masses of firms in both countries. Under increasing demand elasticity, welfare in bigger country is higher (that makes any non-agglomerated migration equilibrium unstable when we allow for migration). These effects are shown analitically for small trade costs or almost-similar countries, and by simlations for AHARA class of utilities."

Using a comprehensive dataset on transportation transactions in Japan, we first describe a directional imbalance of transportation costs by transport mode and examine its potential sources such as density economies, long-haul economies, and a directional imbalance of transport demand. Based on the method of instrumental variables, we find that the density economies drive a deviation of symmetric transport costs between prefectures. We then develop a theoretical model of economic geography in which asymmetric transport costs occur for density economies. Analyzing a spatial distribution of firms in the presence of the transport sector with density economies, we show that as the transport sector become more competitive, agglomeration is more"

Unlike previous research in the urban growth literature, we formulate the model as a one-shot game and take an evolutionary game-theoretic approach for stability analysis. Our approach enables us to analyze stability of nonstationary equilibria in which populations of each region are not constant over time. We show that if both the expenditure share for housing and inter- regional transport cost are small, a stable stationary equilibrium does not exist. Moreover, in such a case, we show that there can exist a stable nonstationary equilibrium in which mobile workers agglomerate in one region at first but some of them migrate to the other region later. We argue that such a nonstationary location pattern is related to return migration."

Environmental pollution has significant negative effect on TFP. Further studies suggest that horizontal FDI spillover effect mitigates the disadvantage effect of environment pollution on industry’ productivity progress and decreases the emission of environment pollution, while on the contrary, the vertical FDI spillover effect (especially through backward linkages) doesn’t mitigate the disadvantage effect of environment pollution on industry’ productivity progress and increases the emission of environment pollution."
